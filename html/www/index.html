    <p>
      Welcome to Saeculum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saeculum is a website about time, and about mortality. Perhaps the
      illustration already made that clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of Saeculum is to serve as a
      <a href=https://time.saeculum.net>time tracker</a>. Most of the utility
      I've found in it I've found in the mindfulness it promotes. Since I began
      to use Saeculum habitually, I've found myself spending less time doing
      nothing. Don't get me wrong, I believe it's important to do nothing
      sometimes, but I was in the habit of slipping into doing nothing <i>by
      accident</i>, and doing nothing by accident usually meant scrolling on my
      phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two of us who run this website. We share the fairly
      uncontroversial philosophy that time is finite, and that one should honor
      that truth by living fully and intentionally every second of their life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully, in addition to the time tracker, Saeculum can be a place where
      visitors can slow down for a minute.
