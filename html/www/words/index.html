    <h2>June 10, 2025</h2>
    <p>
      The fruits of modern technology have alienated&mdash;and are continuing to
      alienate&mdash;people from the tangible things they depend upon. Every
      triumph is a tradeoff, and while I am grateful that I live in a society
      that does not demand its every person farm to subsist, I fear a future in
      which no labor left is performed by humans.

      Carry on, son...

      There is one fundemental currency. Time. Your life is shaped by how you
      spend it.

    <p>
      There are countless things you can do. But nothing can extend it.
