    <h2>August 31, 2024</h2>
    <p>
      The fruits of modern technology have alienated&mdash;and are continuing to
      alienate&mdash;people from the tangible things they depend upon. Every
      triumph is a tradeoff, and while I am grateful that I live in a society
      that does not demand its every person farm to subsist, I fear a future in
      which no labor left is performed by humans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carry on, son...

    <p>
      There is one fundemental currency. <span>Time</span>. Your life is shaped
      by how you spend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are countless things you can do. But nothing can extend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may take those seconds of every day sharpening skills,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or pursuing Nirvana, popping pills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to personify her, time that is;
    </p>
    <p>
    She has no equal, she's the entire package.
    </p>
    <p>
      How we treat her, be it a mistress holding us after a long days work,
    </p>
    <p>
      Or as our queen, object of our devotion, where we sink all our effort our
      labor for but a smirk,
    </p>
    <p>
      It is as I said how our lives come to be—
    </p>
    <p>
    It is a <span>spectacle</span> of true beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, for the industrious few,
    </p>
    <p>
      She does not represent the loving arms you fade into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather a foe, an enemy, someone who is the final barrier to the hopes and
      dreams that can only be reached for but never attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have her become a part of your thoughts, a figure found every time you
      glance over your shoulder, she is the reaper, the only one who can keep
      you contained.
