# Saeculum

In this repo (created by [George](https://github.com/GrogDeFrog) and [Dylan](https://github.com/dleiferives)) is the source code for [Saeculum](https://www.saeculum.net)'s frontend and backend.

The main purpose of Saeculum is to house the [time tracker](https://time.saeculum.net), which I (George) have found helps me be more mindful of my time spent.
